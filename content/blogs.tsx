    "content": "<blockquote><em>judit reached out for a little reflection as part of UWCRCN's 30th anniversary publication. here's what i sent over.</em></blockquote>\n<p>I remember choosing not to go to bed the night before grad. Closing my eyes and falling asleep meant acknowledging the fact I had a <em>last night</em> — and I didn’t want to wake up.  I wasn’t quite ready to leave.</p>\n<p>So I stayed up. <em>We</em> stayed up. We huddled outside Norway house and ate that burnt hot dog. We ventured to the dock, the abandoned house, and the breakup bench one last time. We made our vows to visit each other across continents. We became the night owl’s night owl, polluting the city of Flekke with our laughter. For once, we were pardoned for the midnight rule.</p>\n<p>I believe it takes about 2 years — or rather 2 generations — until you are officially outside of RCN, a final and sentimental bursting of the Flekke bubble. The first year after graduating, I had my firsties to stalk. The second year, I had my firsties tell me about their firsties. By the third year, I am out of juice. Or saft. All I’m left with are the shadows of photos I was once tagged in, <em>dated 3 years ago.</em></p>\n<p>I am met with a harsh realisation: when I scroll through my red circle of Instagram stories, I am no longer met with new first hand videos of life at RCN. Naturally, I don’t follow anyone currently at RCN anymore. And that’s okay. No more midnight dayroom birthday surprises, no more snippets of Høegh parties, no more long complaints of IAs.</p>\n<p>I remember RCN started off bright. Lots of hiking with wet socks and ticks for those in shorts. Lots of where-are-you-froms. Lots of dances, college meetings, and sponsor evenings. But as the darkness arrives, it becomes a lambent moment for us, now that we bring our warmth closer to each other. Surprise snowball fights by upper road. Cozied up roomie dinners. Shovelling snow out of your house leader’s entryway. Volunteering to do your roommates’ laundry to save them an extra freezing walk. Lots of skiing and falling.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the slush melts, and I am reminded Plath said it best: By March, we’ll be rested, caught up and human. The grass turns green, and the robot lawn mower is spotted again. Cramped bus rides to Dale’s football pitch resume. We start spending cookie breaks outside again, basking by the Fjord, and before we know it, exams come and the end of May rolls around. Lots of cries follow.</p>\n<p>We used to complain about the long queues in Kantina — today, I’d gladly wait, even if it extends all the way to Haugland. Even if it was salted cod being served. Here’s an RCN lesson: One never forgets the taste of certain tears and fish.</p>\n<p>Since graduating, I have found myself biking to a Buddhist monastery with a Swede in Thailand’s jungles, catching a late-night bowl of ramen in Tokyo with an Indian, going Asian grocery shopping and run-coffee-hopping with a Canadian in Toronto, hunting deer in the Arctic with a Norwegian, visiting an Uzbek in law school, playing board games with a Moldovan, enjoying jazz with a Dutch in Brussels, sitting in a HK park with a Dane and Lithuanian, day-drinking with a Belizean in a shady pub, and crashing a Argentinian-Spaniard and French-Greek at their cute Eindhoven abode. Truth is, cities aren’t just places anymore; they are forever named after an RCN person I cherish. RCN is no longer just in Flekke. It is scattered.</p>\n<p>Today, I’m back in university within the four-walled jungle of Hong Kong and I thank RCN for where I am today. No cold email or LinkedIn request to alumni has gone unreplied and that’s some true unspoken cross-generational camaraderie. As our final act, we will all set off to become what we once said we were going to do in our CAS reflections.</p>\n<p>Unprompted, I don’t talk about RCN a lot. Not because I don’t want to, but because I find it hard to encapsulate what it truly entails in a mere string of tokens. A sacredness. That’s why when I bump into the RCNer on the roads, I take a moment to indulge myself in some rumination, since there is a mutual appreciation that some feelings can never be described, only experienced.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to be back for the 10-year reunion. But I’ll change one thing, though. Perhaps, as I go back to that corner upper bunk of mine in Sweden house 104, I’ll finally rest my head on that hard blue IKEA mattress, to close my eyes and peacefully recapture that last night of sleep I never had — for now I know RCN could never leave me.</p>\n<p>All along, I hadn’t actually left RCN.</p>"

    "title": "on China and MAIM",
    "date": "December 1 2025",
    "excerpt": "",
    "content": "<p><em>written as an exercise to practise my quick takes from a prompt with limited research. i aim to write a more polished version sometime soon.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve learnt two things about understanding China: they love and operate on their proverbs and understanding the leadership/elite theory is more important than understanding their political system. <strong>Will they pursue MAIM-style sabotage?</strong> My short answer: <strong>No.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party \",</strong> Mao. Xi is more like Mao than Deng, Hu or Jiang in a sense that we return to a strongman rule over collective leadership; some China-watchers believe Xi's words are seen as policy. And Xi is quite ideological. Xi would not let his personal rule and grip hold loose to anyone or anything (ASI). If we look at recent Chinese politburo study sessions, China increasingly sees AI as a tool for ideological purposes and a support condition for regime survival. “Algorithmic sovereignty” as they put it. They’ll much rather both have ASI serving their own respective ideological purpose than no one have ASI. The Xi era prides itself in not being isolated, rather self-reliant with cooperation (i.e the Belt and Road initiative). Xi is cognizant of the failed wolf-warrior era and his political survival is his main priority, and sabotaging/MAIM-style conflict is anything but that. Xi will likely purge anyone who believes otherwise (as he has with the military leadership recently).</p>\n<p><strong>China does not operate and never will operate on a zero-sum game basis.</strong> Xi mentions avoiding the Thucydides trap on many many occasions and if we look at the 15th 5-year plan, the rhetoric is that China has an increasing focus on domestic affairs and self-reliance. Stability above all remains a hallmark on domestic and foreign policy. Understanding China is rather paradoxical: I believe China would rather invest time in making better chips than to sabotage the US. China might intimidate and do smaller scale orchestrated attacks but a full blown MAIM style sabotage on US’s entire AI apparatus seems unlikely. The same reason leadership from the top is heavily pushing for a Shanghai based World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO), they'd like to set the terms and strongarm a collaborative deal rather than do direct acts of aggression.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiding data centers.</strong> Like the alleged Singapore/NVIDIA chip smuggling operations, China (or anyone) can get pretty good at hiding their data centers, like rebranding industrial factories or a sophisticated computer network. Chinese leadership operates on a belief that if they can do something, others (like the US) most likely could too. China would not risk the infeasibility and consequences of a failed MAIM sabotage attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>No guns and butter tradeoff to AI.</strong> Nuclear deterrence works because with nuclear bombs there is an inherent guns and butter trade off, more defense spending means less on . AI is not the same, better AI = better ‘butter’ (consumption, welfare). With AI, especially with China’s adoption strategy (“new productive forces”) to boost GDP/fix domestic economic problems over direct frontier competition, I further do not see them seeing the need to sabotage because China cares about how it looks internally a lot. China operates on a deep belief that win-win is possible and they have the bargaining chips to bring negotiations to the table.</p>\n<p>On a slightly more slight speculative and philosophical note, in a sense American foreign policy is guided on dominance and dynamism. China has been through a century of humiliation, which is still a core in Chinese leadership philosophy on humility. China plays a pretty long game when it comes to national strategy and I don’t think they will feel particularly threatened with the US being (as it already is) leading on ASI. In a sense, Chinese leadership operates in a sense they will always catch-up and win. The US and China play different games.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m very fortunate to study and learn China/CCP’s technocracy and leadership under Prof. Li Cheng (HKU CCCW Founding Director, former Director of John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings Institution). He has been great for inspiring me to think more independently.</p>"

    "title": "my thesis on ai rollups and smbs",
    "date": "October 26 2025",
    "excerpt": "",
    "content": "<blockquote>TL;DR<br/>We're seeing a transfer of wealth + no successors for SMBs in service based economies; Harsh macro conditions (cheaper multiples); RL environments scaled for SMBs; Forward Deployed + Search Fund type consortium</blockquote>\n<p>I tweeted this thought a while back:</p>\n<blockquote>hating ai is like hating electricity</blockquote>\n<p>I’m starting to consider seeing AI through a public utility lens and it got me thinking: when electricity started being introduced, did the shops who had better functioning light bulbs get better sales than the stores that still relied on candles? Could the stores/office who had gas heating start work earlier than those who didn’t during cold harsh winters? Did restaurants who had electricity for refrigerators first get margins because they could store leftovers overnight?</p>\n<p>These questions seem rather stupid but in a sense seem quite interesting to think about even knowing there will never be a satisfying answer. A lot of small medium businesses (SMBs) definitely hear about AI, but don’t think much about how to implement it. Maybe because they don’t care or maybe they’re content the way they are operating. Somtimes it’s the idea that, okay if I could automate this, what else would I do with the saved time? They frame it as that they prefer the satisfaction of actually running their own businesses.</p>\n<p>It seems to me AI can only ever be adopted are for medium corps where the C-suite wants it, or the employees implement it from the ground up or getting someone who wants to implement AI in a businesses to straight up buying out and owning the business. I started looking more into the latter and figured I’d a brain dump on AI acquisitions and rollups.</p>\n<p>The traditional search fund way of buying and owning one business is worthy of an essay itself but I’d focus on AI rollups here — basically, scooping up small, fragmented service businesses and juicing them with AI to crank up efficiency and margins. There’s also some financial engineering optimizing to do in the valuations, but in a sense, this feels like a private equity meets venture capital play, but with a tech twist.</p>\n<p><strong>a palantir for SMBs + special acquisition vehicle?</strong> The core idea: Instead of just building software and hoping SMBs (small and medium businesses) buy it, why not buy the businesses themselves?</p>\n<p>Acquire them cheap, layer on AI to automate the grunt work, and turn low-margin ops into something scalable. I first got fairly hooked reading about how this is blowing up in the US, with VCs like General Catalyst earmarking 1.5B for their Creation Fund in AI-enabled rollups, or Thrive Capital backing plays like Long Lake with 18 HOA management acquisitions and 600M raised, plus Crete targeting 500M in accounting firm buys. They’re not just really just slashing costs like old-school PE; they’re using AI to rethink the whole service delivery to be AI-native. Or a full stack AI company as YC puts it (we’re seeing a rise in these companies backed in later batches, see Cranston and Claybird)</p>\n<blockquote>When you launch a firm that’s born around agentic workflows, every email, model, and meeting transcript is captured in a clean, structured form from day one. That ‘data exhaust’ feeds the very agents that automate the next engagement, so gross margin expands with each client you serve. (Lyseng)</blockquote>\n<p><strong>vc vs pe investment approach</strong> Let’s break down the approaches, because not all rollups are created equal. Traditional private equity (PE) rollups are about buying cheap (1-3x EBITDA would be a steal), consolidating, cutting fat, and flipping at higher multiples — think heavy debt and operational tweaks, but not rehualing the company completely. VC-backed ones? They’re betting on AI. Less leverage, more tech infusion for margin expansion without gutting the team.</p>\n<p>Diving deeper, PE's bread and butter is multiple arbitrage: snag assets at low multiples in fragmented markets, bolt them together for scale, and exit at 5-10x EBITDA thanks to synergies and professionalization acriss the board. But AI rollups amp this up — VCs like Thrive and General Catalyst are blending in venture-scale upside by embedding AI for gross margin jumps, say from 20-30% in services to software-like 60-80% through automation of knowledge work. The idea is that it is not just cost cutting; AI enables revenue growth via better products, like in staffing where models handle unlimited multilingual calls with zero bias. Risks lurk in integration— PE pros know the drill with cultural clashes and debt loads in high-interest eras, but VCs bring the AI hype, often underestimating ops complexity.</p>\n<p>From what I’ve pieced together, VCs like Thrive Capital and General Catalyst are going PE-style but AI-native: acquire fragmented players, embed AI for automation, and scale outcomes. Thrive’s got over 1B for this, partnering with OpenAI to customize models for acquired firms in accounting and IT. General Catalyst’s “creation strategy” and Perceptra arm incubates AI companies then buys services biz to transform (100-150M checks for stuff like Crescendo in call centers, which acquired PartnerHero and hit ~90M revenue by May 2025)</p>\n<p>AI commoditizes software, so owning the customers (via acquisitions) beats selling tools they might ignore. PE pros handle integration perils, but VCs bring the AI hype for upside.</p>\n<p><strong>why i’m bullish, especially for hk’s aging services scene</strong> I know Hong Kong’s economy and business landscape the best and here are my two cents of how it might work here: there could be a play here where the economy’s all services, the population’s graying fast, and SMBs are scrambling to stay afloat without enough young hands (the children going to be doctors, lawyers or bankers instead of taking over an old-school business.</p>\n<p>Refining my take: AI rollups aren’t just a trend; they could be a lifeline for service-heavy economies staring down demographic cliffs. Hong Kong’s a prime example—financial services, tourism, retail dominate, accounting for 93.5% of GDP in 2023, but with an aging pop and talent drain, SMBs are hurting. AI could pump HK 260B into the economy, juicing finance by HK 83B via better fraud detection and modeling, tourism by HK 15B through personalized itineraries, and e-commerce by HK 5.7B with optimized ads and automation. (HK census and gov data).</p>\n<p>Zooming in on the AI mechanics, integration often starts with forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) embedding in acquired firms to map workflows—think shadowing workers to spot automatable tasks like data entry or content gen, then layering LLMs for 20-30% efficiency gains. In PE terms, this drives EBITDA lifts of 2-3x by automating core services, not just back-office, creating defensible moats via proprietary datasets from rollups. For HK's silver economy (which is a major policy direction push), where the elderly (65+) hit 22.4% or 1.68M in 2023 and are projected to reach 35% or 2.67M by 2043, with median age at 47.4 in 2025, AI handles repetitive elder care like fall detection or personalized plans, freeing scarce labor while scaling services in a market where 20%+ are over 65.</p>\n<p>Pushback I’ve heard: critics often say AI rollups won’t stick because tech vendors already flood these markets, or integration’s a nightmare—like how 42% of enterprise AI initiatives got axed in 2024, up from 17% in 2023. Fair, but in aging spots like HK, where SMBs lag on AI adoption (only 2% fully prepped per Cisco), rollups force the upgrade. Plus, data from owned assets trains better ctiadel models, creating potential moats.</p>\n<blockquote>unrelated, BVP's memo on ServiceTitan has relevant ideas on service transformation; <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/memos/servicetitan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">memo</a></blockquote>\n<p><strong>investment professionals don’t think too deply about implementation</strong> What often rollups bull cases miss, or rather just assume is that the tech with some smart engineers will diffuse automatically. Most attempts still revolve around superficial orchestration: wrapping large language models around existing workflows via simplistic retrieval-augmented generation or basic tool-calling scaffolds. But the durable benefits emerge in a different way.</p>\n<p>I could see Prime Intellect’s verifiers and RL environments being quite interesting to consider for SMB use cases. The subtle bottleneck here is context and proprietary data.</p>\n<p>Most AI rollups essays/memos focus more actually on <em>medium</em> businesses rather than the <em>small</em>. By small I mean accounting firms with 3-5 people or family businesses run by 3 siblings. Admitedly, finding them are quite hard but sometimes if they’re looking for exit liquidity or have no successor, an opportunity might present itself. I haven’t found any good community/broker for this yet tho. HK business has a lot to do with <em>guanxi</em>.</p>\n<p>That said, if you happen to be/have friends who’s a cracked sales/ops guy, a cracked engineer and someone who knows their M&amp;A well, this seems like the thing to do.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Acquire cash-flowing SMBs, use AI for efficiency (e.g., automate back-office, expand outcomes), fund more buys. In aging economies, it compensates for workforce shrinks — AI creates abundance, dropping costs for goods/services while upskilling what’s left. For HK SMBs, it’s high leverage. I know the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce wants to help SMBs, maybe there is a conversation to be had there.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Folks/Players to watch:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Multiplier Holdings, Percepta (General Catalyst), Thrive Holdings</li><li>Related: Chamath’s 8090, Tenex (more consultancy/FDE style), <a href=\"https://varickagents.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Varick Agents</a></li><li>Our favorite tweets/X people on adoption: ~<a href=\"https://x.com/liamottley_/status/1968158436820128137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liam Ottley</a>~, ~<a href=\"https://x.com/vasumanmoza/status/1963358362675863934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vas</a>~, ~<a href=\"https://x.com/amirmxt/status/1960838464460529853\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amirmxt</a>~, ~<a href=\"https://x.com/kirbyman01/status/1950572170247319807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bryan Kim</a>~, @rohitdotmittal</li><li>VCs: Hemant Taneja/Marc Bhargava (General Catalyst): Leading the 1.5B Creation Fund, Josh Kushner (Thrive Capital)/Crete (accounting acquisitions), Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures), Trace Cohen (Six Point Ventures), Chris Young (ex-Microsoft venture &amp; acqusition lead)</li><li>Sahil Patwa, Evan Lyseng (does really good substack pieces)</li><li>Sceptics: Dave Friedman, John Hwang</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Reading list:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.vinayiyengar.com/2025/01/17/the-dawn-of-ai-rollups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Dawn of AI Rollups – The Vin Diagram</a></li><li><a href=\"https://evanlyseng.substack.com/p/turning-customers-into-investments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turning Customers into Investments - by Evan Lyseng</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sahilpatwa.substack.com/p/ai-powered-roll-ups-part-i-a-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI-powered Roll-ups - Part I: A Framework for Industry Selection</a></li><li><a href=\"https://davefriedman.substack.com/p/ai-rollups-wont-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI rollups won't work - by Dave Friedman</a></li><li><a href=\"https://sahilpatwa.substack.com/p/ai-powered-roll-ups-part-v-build\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI-Powered Roll-ups Part V: Build  AI+Services Organically or Through Roll-ups?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://nextword.substack.com/p/ai-tech-enabled-roll-ups-are-a-dumb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI / Tech-Enabled Roll Ups are a Dumb Idea - by John Hwang</a></li><li><a href=\"https://geeksofthevalley.substack.com/p/vcs-go-pe-the-promise-and-perils\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VCs Go PE: The Promise and Perils of Venture-Backed Roll-Up Strategies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/evanlyseng/p/ai-rollups-revisited?r=2m5jvu&utm_medium=ios\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">￼AI Rollups Revisited</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/stories/the-future-of-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Future of Services</a></li></ul>"

Also how fast I am accelerating is also important.</p>\n<p>But to find how fast I am running (speed), that <strong>depends on how many kms I am running.</strong> And to determine how fast I am accelerating, <strong>that depends on my speed</strong>?!!</p>\n<p><strong>So not only do I have multiple variables x, t and z, now I have variables where it is a function that depend on other functions, which depend on even MORE variables?</strong></p>\n<p>Stick with me, it’ll make more sense. This is where calculus is brought in. I won’t try to even explain what calculus is or confuse you with the actual calculations themselves, but you just have to know this:</p>\n<p><strong>Calculus is like a guide to how to extract more information from an equation, which is split into two types: Derivative and Integrals.</strong></p>\n<p>*  <strong>Derivatives: how fast the speed is changing (acceleration)</strong></p>\n<p>*  <strong>Integrals: how far we have driven (distance)</strong></p>\n<p>In simple words:</p>\n<p>* ‘Regular’ calculus: We have some X and it depends on some Y</p>\n<p>* Multivariable calculus: you start having X, Y, Z and all possibly a bunch of greek symbols that make it look more scary than it is (σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω)</p>\n<p>* Differential equations: we have X, Y, Z and functions that depend on other functions or variables.</p>\n<p>High school and most first-year universities kind of stop at here.

anymore. We need to somehow convert it into computer language so we can get a computer to ‘solve it for us’.</p>\n<p>But we have to realise not all of them are necessarily solvable, so what we can do is sort of approximate an answer that is good enough for us to use.</p>\n<p><strong>That’s the whole field of numerical methods and using code to approximate solutions that are useful for us. Differential equation solvers are basically competent coders, which makes them valuable no matter domain they end up in.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s exactly why hedge funds like Citadel and Jane Street hire so many physicist who spent their whole career solving niche astrophysical fluid dynamic equations - you can hire them and retrain to solve different numerical problems instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Fundamentally, the methods you used to solve them are similar to an extent.</strong></p>\n<p>Now if you stop back for a second and think, you can start seeing the world as a series of changes depending on each other. Maybe one thing depends on one other thing (calculus) or maybe one thing depends on many other things (multivariable). It is all about finding a way to model nature accurately.</p>\n<ul><li><em> </em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>(Extra) Part IV: Is this Artificial Intelligence then?</strong></p>\n<p>Not quite, but the input-output mental model remains.</p>\n<p>All the above equations I showed you fundamentally takes some input and provide some output, but some person (or renaissance period polymath) must have decided that the equation must look like that. No one just wakes up and decide the fluid equations to be in that very form.</p>\n<p>Here comes AI (or more specifically neural networks &amp; deep learning)!</p>\n<p>Traditionally, we try to write the equation out that should be solved for an output. But let’s say hey, we don’t actually need a equation since the output (answer) is what really matters to us. <strong>What if we can give a computer lots of examples (data) and it finds some pattern for us?</strong></p>\n<p>This is what these ‘AI systems’ are essentially doing. It takes in lots of data (hence, big data) and does some black magic to learn patterns and insights we humans cannot see and then provides a useful predictive output.</p>\n<p>But as you can see, the issue is that since we only get an output, we don’t know how the AI has actually learned, nor can we ensure the output we get is what we want or safe. That’s what people mean when AI is actually just a black box. Also why I think interpretability is a direction worth spending time on.</p>\n<ul><li><em> </em></li></ul>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<p>This essay was kind of inspired after a similar conversation occurring a few times with friends studying across various STEM fields.

    "content": "<h3>my initial theory</h3>\n<p>I brought up this working hypothesis with a few friends.</p>\n<blockquote> The best conversation trick in all walks of life is to know what’s best or most prestigious in as many fields as possible.</blockquote>\n<p>My logic was along the lines of this: Everyone is obviously involved in some industry, domain or has some interest. By knowing the ‘best’ in their industries, or hobbies and being able to name-drop it in your conversation with them, it prompts the discussion towards a direction they are obviously educated or passionate about. And people talk the most when they are knowledgeable and opinionated.</p>\n<p>Say the biggest football clubs, the most prestigious private equity firms or the greatest fashion designers.</p>\n<p>It’s like talking to foreign friend and casually dropping a national dish or word in their native language. They’ll go ‘wait, how do you know that’. My experience suggests a similar reaction with this approach, knowing their interest.</p>\n<p>With the suitable follow-up, you’ve set yourself up for a mildly less awkward conversation. The hallmark wisdom of conversing is to get people talking about themselves.</p>\n<p>I got pushed back that this theory assumes that one must be interested in prestige for this to work. Similarly, with the wrong person, you also come off with the risk of being unable to discuss further beyond your surface understanding: being able to talk the talk but not walk the walk.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent some time refining the idea.</p>\n<h3>your interest should be benchmarked</h3>\n<p>I’ve since consolidated my theory to this:</p>\n<blockquote>Know as many players in as many games as possible. And know the benchmarks of the game.</blockquote>\n<p>I use the word _game_ as a loose term in place of industry, domain, hobby, interest etc.</p>\n<p>I think it ties into knowing the nuances in excellence for each field or art - it gives you something to notice and look for. A side benefit of basically trying a bunch of things in life is that you get to experience what is hard. Shaving 5 minutes off a marathon seems easy on the outside, until you hit the roads and try it out yourself.</p>\n<p>Just to name a few examples:</p>\n<ul><li>To talk to a runner, having a mental benchmark of what a fast km is helps ground the conversation.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To talk about watches, know the main brands and the ‘if you know, you know’ type of features of watches, like the type of band or nuances in bezel color.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To talk about coffee, know the difference between espresso machines, cold brew/drip coffees, or the AeroPress.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To talk about suits, know the difference between an Italian vs American tailored cut or notice collar gaps and oversized suits.</li></ul>\n<p>Asking questions is an innocuous way of employing this technique, without appearing sort of overly aggressive or dismissive of their field. You don’t have to actually know too much about how the espresso machine actually makes the coffee - you just need to bring up that you are aware of the difference and nuances of their interest.</p>\n<h3>getting the ball rolling</h3>\n<p>This strategy works best for getting the ball rolling - once their initial comments are out, you switch back to the regular conversation tricks from Dale Carnegie or whatever power law from Robert Greene. Or whatever rocks your boat.</p>\n<p>It gets the awkwardness out of the way.</p>\n<p>Emil once told me about his friend who claims to have watched movies just by having read their Wikipedia page summary. This strategy sort of reminds me of that, just don’t cap too hard though.</p>\n<p>I guess it definitely takes some innate curiosity to be able to channel effort to grasp the greats across various domains. Maybe there is an optimal strategy for knowing the players and benchmarks in this list of 4-5 domains and being able to deploy it with 80% of the population; I’m thinking knowing one sport (e.g, Basketball/Football) will be pretty high leverage. Knowing the latest of something (celebs/songs/movies) also works quite well. I will have to put more thought into refining a more optimal list, though - perhaps an essay for another day.</p>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<p>I wrote this mini essay to get my productive spirits up again. I’ve been having lots of thoughts on AI, policy, and general reflections recently, resulting in too many half-finished pieces. They shall see the light of day soon.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I checked my watch. 21:28 3rd of April 2025. I was just sitting there in an empty park, slowly swaying back and forth on a swing.</p>\n<p>Out of nowhere, I heard a faint ‘sewwyyyy’. Followed by a thump on the ground from a silhouette with Ronaldo’s stance.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, a kid, no taller than the gates he had just leaped over, had sort of just spawned there. He rushed past me on the swing and remarked “Gosh you are so boring just sitting there. Booooooring.”</p>\n<p>I was taken aback by this surprising first remark from a stranger. I replied back “hey, it’s nice!”</p>\n<p>He swerved around the monkey bars and picked up his sweater from the floor, then made his way towards the empty swing seat to my right.</p>\n<p>“How old are you? 13? 15?” he questioned me.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t sure whether I was to take that as a compliment or insult: “I’m a little older than that, I’m 19 now.”</p>\n<p>He started to add momentum to the swing by stretching his legs and replied “Oh cool, I’m 10 and 3/4. But anyway, I was playing football here for 3 hours earlier but left my sweater here so I’m here to pick it up alone. I just finished 1/8th of the Lasagna at home, but my baby sisters are probably still eating. I finished as fast as I could so I didn’t have to talk to them. I live somewhere around the corner. But anyway, the swing is so boring, you’re so boring, why are you sitting here?”</p>\n<p>He seemed to have some personal vendetta against the swing. I explained to him I had just gone for a run and was just resting here before I went home, which was just across the road.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you go home then? You can rest there. And why sit on the swing, you can sit on the park bench or even on the slide!”</p>\n<p>I told him I enjoyed just sitting here, it was relaxing with the back-and-forth motion.</p>\n<p>“The swing is so boring. I never sit here.”</p>\n<p>I rebutted, “Then why are you on the swing next to me?”</p>\n<p>“Well, ‘cause I am talking to you. Duh…” Good point, kid.</p>\n<p>He continued, “Anyway, you know what brain rot is? I play Brawl Stars, and Max is my favorite character; do you play any games? I also play football, goalkeeper and striker like Ronaldo. Do you play any sports?”</p>\n<p>I told him “Yeah, no, school is too busy for me, I don’t really have time to do all that”. I’ve always felt uneasy using my lack of time as a cheap excuse for anything; I know I’m just covering up some deeper reason for my inaction.</p>\n<p>He cut off my train of thought and looked at me. “I don’t know many teenagers but I saw this meme and it said that: adults have money but not time, kids have time but no money, and teenagers have no time and no money. Is is true?”</p>\n<p>I laughed. “Yeah seems pretty right, you know…“</p>\n<p>He cut me off again before I could finish validating his claim. “Well if you don’t have time to do anything then why are you just sitting here on the swing? You could be like me playing football or brawl stars. I guess you just don’t want to.”</p>\n<p>“You know, maybe you’re right.” I liked his bluntness.</p>\n<p>“I think you have the time to do fun stuff if you want to. I saw the Minecraft movie and played football for 3 hours and went to school all in one day. Oh and deal with my sisters who cry for 1 hour each day. I’m half your age, but I think I’ve done more than you.”</p>\n<p>He wasn’t wrong. As a kid, he just did things. He didn’t weigh in on whether watching the Minecraft movie for 2 hours or playing football for 3 hours would take away time from playing Brawl Stars. He didn’t think about optimizing the hours of his day - he was a man of momentum. Avoiding boredom was his goal, not trying to feel productive. But by minimizing boredom, he was truly maximizing potential productivity. I obviously wasn’t maximizing every waking hour, so time was not the bottleneck to my inaction; I need to put my focus on doing things that I have the energy to do at the moment and not an ounce on debating whether there is something better I can do in this instance. My true bottleneck was focus, energy, or courage.*</p>\n<p>Perhaps that’s the subconscious reason why I preferred sitting on the swings over the park bench, it made me feel as though I was doing something moving back and forth. I couldn’t justify just idly sitting on the park bench like a wasteman, and the motion of the swing served as my excuse.</p>\n<p>A car vroomed by behind the gates of the park. ‘That’s my Dad, gotta go!’</p>\n<p>He leaped off the swing and headed in the distance towards the car, jumping above the bushes and gate that still towered him. “I’ll probably never see you again. See you never!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, probably not, see you never” I replied.</p>\n<blockquote>frequently “I don’t have enough time” is polite social fiction , and that’s good actually. but you shouldn’t accidentally start believing it yourself. ~ <a href=\"https://x.com/tautologer/status/1903524222275924105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tautologer</a></blockquote>"

    "excerpt": "",
    "content": "<p>I’ve been trying to find my raison d’être for starting to write.</p>\n<p>For a while, I tried relying on the FOMO of seeing those closest around me write (<a href=\"https://emilryd.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emil</a>, <a href=\"https://vivianhelau.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vivian</a>, even <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110938401-ninni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ilinca</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186295515-thuraya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thuraya</a>’s goodreads reviews). I’ve also tried to gaslight myself into the desire to balance my overconsumption of brainrot with some production. But the excuses just piled up and starting this little writing gig soon became harder than my postgrad machine learning course - until I realised I can literally just write about why I should write.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I won’t take this writing gig too seriously - in a sense, I won’t try to perfect each piece and publish, but probably momentarily write up and dump my brains onto the page.</p>\n<p>I’ve always seen writing as medium of thinking for yourself ahead of time; you know, like writing a script for your future conversation. I’ve also come to the belief that forming my own world view and series of predictions will probably be the best life/career guidance I can have at this point of life. There’s nothing more exciting to me than hearing others gush about their convictions with unparalleled passion; there’s something revealing about one’s personality via their ideas (platitudes and niche ones alike). Perhaps my reason shall be this for now: I will write to figure out where my convictions lie.</p>\n<p>For most parts of education and life, I’ve been dabbling in things that sort of appeared to me as interesting with no true optimisations. I mediocrely dipped my toes in a range of fields (briefly academic research, government, finance and tech) I cared about at the time, only to catch myself in boredom at the end of it.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s my reels-infected attention span. Maybe it wasn’t for me. Truth is, I’ve been told over and over again that doing one thing well will probably get you furthest in life; but sticking to one thing always seemed to risky to me - it’s my fear of boredom and the dread of the climb up. But the facts don’t lie, high optionality breeds mediocrity.</p>\n<p>For selfish and maybe altruistic reasons (go open source!), fleshing all my ideas and predictions via writing may reveal something deeper about my world view or might hopefully serve as a springboard for further discussions. I’m more likely to spot my own bs on paper than in my head.</p>\n<p>A last note, I’ve always been fortunate enough to be closely surrounded by those who either are on are bullish on a mission with no temptation to pivot or a very well-cut optimised prestigious paths (law, banking and big tech), making it clear what their next step might be.</p>\n<p>To simply put it: I’m surrounded by excellence and I need to take my next steps to catch up, but I can’t do that until I figure out the bearings for my bullishness. And that is one heck of a topic to start writing about.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for my following pieces to come shortly, I’ve been half baking a lot.</p>"
