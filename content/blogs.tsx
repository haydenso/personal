    "content": "<p><em>written as an exercise to practise my quick takes from a prompt with limited research. i aim to write a more polished version sometime soon.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve learnt two things about understanding China: they love and operate on their proverbs and understanding the leadership/elite theory is more important than understanding their political system. <strong>Will they pursue MAIM-style sabotage?</strong> My short answer: <strong>No.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party \",</strong> Mao. Xi is more like Mao than Deng, Hu or Jiang in a sense that we return to a strongman rule over collective leadership; some China-watchers believe Xi's words are seen as policy. And Xi is quite ideological. Xi would not let his personal rule and grip hold loose to anyone or anything (ASI). If we look at recent Chinese politburo study sessions, China increasingly sees AI as a tool for ideological purposes and a support condition for regime survival. “Algorithmic sovereignty” as they put it. They’ll much rather both have ASI serving their own respective ideological purpose than no one have ASI. The Xi era prides itself in not being isolated, rather self-reliant with cooperation (i.e the Belt and Road initiative). Xi is cognizant of the failed wolf-warrior era and his political survival is his main priority, and sabotaging/MAIM-style conflict is anything but that. Xi will likely purge anyone who believes otherwise (as he has with the military leadership recently).</p>\n<p><strong>China does not operate and never will operate on a zero-sum game basis.</strong> Xi mentions avoiding the Thucydides trap on many many occasions and if we look at the 15th 5-year plan, the rhetoric is that China has an increasing focus on domestic affairs and self-reliance. Stability above all remains a hallmark on domestic and foreign policy. Understanding China is rather paradoxical: I believe China would rather invest time in making better chips than to sabotage the US. China might intimidate and do smaller scale orchestrated attacks but a full blown MAIM style sabotage on US’s entire AI apparatus seems unlikely. The same reason leadership from the top is heavily pushing for a Shanghai based World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO), they'd like to set the terms and strongarm a collaborative deal rather than do direct acts of aggression.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiding data centers.</strong> Like the alleged Singapore/NVIDIA chip smuggling operations, China (or anyone) can get pretty good at hiding their data centers, like rebranding industrial factories or a sophisticated computer network. Chinese leadership operates on a belief that if they can do something, others (like the US) most likely could too. China would not risk the infeasibility and consequences of a failed MAIM sabotage attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>No guns and butter tradeoff to AI.</strong> Nuclear deterrence works because with nuclear bombs there is an inherent guns and butter trade off, more defense spending means less on . AI is not the same, better AI = better ‘butter’ (consumption, welfare). With AI, especially with China’s adoption strategy (“new productive forces”) to boost GDP/fix domestic economic problems over direct frontier competition, I further do not see them seeing the need to sabotage because China cares about how it looks internally a lot. China operates on a deep belief that win-win is possible and they have the bargaining chips to bring negotiations to the table.</p>\n<p>On a slightly more slight speculative and philosophical note, in a sense American foreign policy is guided on dominance and dynamism. China has been through a century of humiliation, which is still a core in Chinese leadership philosophy on humility. China plays a pretty long game when it comes to national strategy and I don’t think they will feel particularly threatened with the US being (as it already is) leading on ASI. In a sense, Chinese leadership operates in a sense they will always catch-up and win. The US and China play different games.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I’m very fortunate to study and learn China/CCP’s technocracy and leadership under Prof. Li Cheng (HKU CCCW Founding Director, former Director of John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings Institution). He has been great for inspiring me to think more independently.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I remember choosing not to go to bed the night before grad. Closing my eyes and falling asleep meant acknowledging the fact I had a <em>last night</em> — and I didn’t want to wake up.  I wasn’t quite ready to leave.</p>\n<p>So I stayed up. <em>We</em> stayed up. We huddled outside Norway house and ate that burnt hot dog. We ventured to the dock, the abandoned house, and the breakup bench one last time. We made our vows to visit each other across continents. We became the night owl’s night owl, polluting the city of Flekke with our laughter. For once, we were pardoned for the midnight rule.</p>\n<p>I believe it takes about 2 years — or rather 2 generations — until you are officially outside of RCN, a final and sentimental bursting of the Flekke bubble. The first year after graduating, I had my firsties to stalk. The second year, I had my firsties tell me about their firsties. By the third year, I am out of juice. Or saft. All I’m left with are the shadows of photos I was once tagged in, <em>dated 3 years ago.</em></p>\n<p>I am met with a harsh realisation: when I scroll through my red circle of Instagram stories, I am no longer met with new first hand videos of life at RCN. Naturally, I don’t follow anyone currently at RCN anymore. And that’s okay. No more midnight dayroom birthday surprises, no more snippets of Høegh parties, no more long complaints of IAs.</p>\n<p>I remember RCN started off bright. Lots of hiking with wet socks and ticks for those in shorts. Lots of where-are-you-froms. Lots of dances, college meetings, and sponsor evenings. But as the darkness arrives, it becomes a lambent moment for us, now that we bring our warmth closer to each other. Surprise snowball fights by upper road. Cozied up roomie dinners. Shovelling snow out of your house leader’s entryway. Volunteering to do your roommates’ laundry to save them an extra freezing walk. Lots of skiing and falling.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the slush melts, and I am reminded Plath said it best: By March, we’ll be rested, caught up and human. The grass turns green, and the robot lawn mower is spotted again. Cramped bus rides to Dale’s football pitch resume. We start spending cookie breaks outside again, basking by the Fjord, and before we know it, exams come and the end of May rolls around. Lots of cries follow.</p>\n<p>We used to complain about the long queues in Kantina — today, I’d gladly wait, even if it extends all the way to Haugland. Even if it was salted cod being served. Here’s an RCN lesson: One never forgets the taste of certain tears and fish. Since graduating, I have found myself biking to a Buddhist monastery with a Swede in Thailand’s jungles, catching a late-night bowl of ramen in Tokyo with an Indian, going Asian grocery shopping and run-coffee-hopping with a Canadian in Toronto, hunting deer in the Arctic with a Norwegian, visiting an Uzbek in law school, playing board games with a Moldovan, enjoying jazz with a Dutch, sitting in a HK park with a Dane and Lithuanian, day-drinking with a Belizean in a shady pub, and crashing a Argentinian-Spaniard and French-Greek at their cute Eindhoven abode. Truth is, cities aren’t just places anymore; they are forever named after an RCN person I cherish. RCN is no longer just in Flekke. It is scattered.</p>\n<p>Today, I’m back in university within the four-walled jungle of Hong Kong, spending time working on AI and policy as we weather through this intelligence revolution. I’ve since spent time with my government in Brussels, in academia, in software, and in private equity, and I thank RCN for where I am today. No cold email or LinkedIn request to alumni has gone unreplied and that’s some true unspoken cross-generational camaraderie. As our final act, we all set off to become what we once said we were going to do in our CAS reflections.</p>\n<p>Unprompted, I don’t talk about RCN a lot. Not because I don’t want to, but because I find it hard to encapsulate what it truly entails in a mere string of tokens. A sacredness. That’s why when I bump into the RCNer on the roads, I take a moment to indulge myself in some rumination, since there is a mutual appreciation that some feelings can never be described, only experienced.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to be back for the 10-year reunion. But I’ll change one thing, though. Perhaps, as I go back to that corner upper bunk of mine in Sweden house 104, I’ll finally rest my head on that hard blue IKEA mattress, to close my eyes and peacefully recapture that last night of sleep I never had — for now I know RCN could never leave me. All along, I hadn’t actually left RCN.</p>"

Maybe _x_ is the cost of an apple. Simple intuition tells us that we have <strong>2</strong> _ <strong>x</strong>_ or <strong>2 apples</strong> (the number in front of _x_ ) and the total price is $4, hence each apple must cost <strong>$2.</strong> But it also works if x is oranges. Or kiwis.</p>\n<p>Now we take one step further:</p>\n<p>\\\\(x+y=4\\\\)</p>\n<p>This is simple addition. An immediate answer might be _<strong>x=2</strong>_ <strong>and</strong> _ <strong>y=2</strong>_ , hence the equations works since 2+2=4. But we see _<strong>x=1</strong>_ <strong>and</strong> _ <strong>y=3</strong>_ also works. _<strong>x=0.0001</strong>_ <strong>and</strong> _ <strong>y=3.9999</strong>_ too! What is going on???</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously, there is an infinite amount of ways to solve it, so we obvious have to rely on one (of</strong> _ <strong>x</strong>_ <strong>or</strong> _ <strong>y</strong>_ <strong>) to get the other. Let’s decide we will provide an x to expect some y.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\\(1 + y = 4, \\text{hence } y = 3\\\\)</p>\n<p>It’s obvious that for some <strong>input (</strong> or we call it a <strong>variable) x</strong> , we get some <strong>output (answer) y.</strong> A nicer way to write this can be:</p>\n<p>\\\\(y=4-x\\\\)</p>\n<p>In other words we can describe this as <strong>y is a function of x.</strong> Another way I like to think about the word function is that y <strong>depends</strong> on x. Whatever _x_ we plug into our function _f( )_ , we get a _y._</p>\n<p>\\\\(f(x) = y\\\\)</p>\n<ul><li><em> </em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Part II: Where most people stop</strong></p>\n<p>Now you understand functions. And variables (our ‘x’). But rarely things in reality only depend on one thing, _only x_. Life is complex and it depends on many many factors.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you wanna predict <strong>how tired you are after a run.</strong> It might depend on variables such as:</p>\n<p>* How much you ran in km/miles (x),</p>\n<p>* How much you slept in hours (t)</p>\n<p>* How much rice you’ve eaten before in kg (z).</p>\n<p>Imagine to find out it is as simple as adding it all up all the numbers, which we can say <strong>to find how tired you will be, it is a function of the x, t and z described above</strong> :</p>\n<p>\\\\(\\text{tiredness score} = f(x,t,z) = x + t +z\\\\)</p>\n<p>While that might be useful, you might realise, no actually, to identify how tired I am, what matters more is how fast I run actually. Also how fast I am accelerating is also important.</p>\n<p>But to find how fast I am running (speed), that <strong>depends on how many kms I am running.</strong> And to determine how fast I am accelerating, <strong>that depends on my speed</strong>?!!</p>\n<p><strong>So not only do I have multiple variables x, t and z, now I have variables where it is a function that depend on other functions, which depend on even MORE variables?</strong></p>\n<p>Stick with me, it’ll make more sense. This is where calculus is brought in. I won’t try to even explain what calculus is or confuse you with the actual calculations themselves, but you just have to know this:</p>\n<p><strong>Calculus is like a guide to how to extract more information from an equation, which is split into two types: Derivative and Integrals.</strong></p>\n<p>*  <strong>Derivatives: how fast the speed is changing (acceleration)</strong></p>\n<p>*  <strong>Integrals: how far we have driven (distance)</strong></p>\n<p>In simple words:</p>\n<p>* ‘Regular’ calculus: We have some X and it depends on some Y</p>\n<p>* Multivariable calculus: you start having X, Y, Z and all possibly a bunch of greek symbols that make it look more scary than it is (σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω)</p>\n<p>* Differential equations: we have X, Y, Z and functions that depend on other functions or variables.</p>\n<p>High school and most first-year universities kind of stop at here. But the fun and application starts.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Garrity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thomas Garrity</a> (who I’ve kindly borrowed for this essay’s title) puts it:</p>\n<blockquote>Everything is describe by functions.<br/><br/>The sound of my voice. Function.<br/><br/>The light in your eyes. Functions.<br/><br/>Different areas of mathematics study different kinds of functions. <br/><br/>BUT IT’S ALL FUNCTIONS. </blockquote>\n<ul><li><em> </em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Part III: Functions to describe the world</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve gone over what you kind of need to grasp from our <strong>how tired you are after a run.</strong></p>\n<p>While the equations might look wildly different, primarily due to them having different variables (and oh boy do mathematicians like using a range of greek symbols), if you look carefully, the following is kind of in every equation:</p>\n<p>\\\\(\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial t} , \\nabla, \\frac{dY}{dt}\\\\)</p>\n<p>This is what we were talking about when we talked about rate of change (or ‘gradients’ more specifically). They are all <strong>differential equations</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in finance?</strong> The ‘billion-dollar’ Black-Scholes Equation (used for options pricing) - see it as an extension of pricing the stock market as you understand it.</p>\n<p>\\\\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{ \\partial \\mathrm t } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\mathrm S^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm C^2} \\+ \\mathrm r \\mathrm S \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm C}{\\partial \\mathrm S}\\ = \\mathrm r \\mathrm C \\\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in the weather and planets? Interested in boats, planes or rockets?</strong> To know this, we wanna know how water or air behaves using the Navier-Stokes equations.</p>\n<p>\\\\(\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{f} ] [ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\\\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in telecommunications (wifi, mobile data)?</strong> Here is part of the Maxwell Equations:</p>\n<p>\\\\( \\quad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} \\\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in how humans behave and social systems? How about how fast rumours spread?</strong> We can model the speed of it spreading using the SIR model.</p>\n<p>\\\\(\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta S I, \\quad \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta S I - \\gamma I, \\quad \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I\\\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in economics?</strong> Here is the textbook Solow–Swan model, describing long run economic growth.</p>\n<p>\\\\(\\frac{dK}{dt} = s Y - \\delta K\\\\)</p>\n<p>What you have to realise is that at some point, these equations become so complex you cannot just solve it by hand anymore. We need to somehow convert it into computer language so we can get a computer to ‘solve it for us’.</p>\n<p>But we have to realise not all of them are necessarily solvable, so what we can do is sort of approximate an answer that is good enough for us to use.</p>\n<p><strong>That’s the whole field of numerical methods and using code to approximate solutions that are useful for us. Differential equation solvers are basically competent coders, which makes them valuable no matter domain they end up in.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s exactly why hedge funds like Citadel and Jane Street hire so many physicist who spent their whole career solving niche astrophysical fluid dynamic equations - you can hire them and retrain to solve different numerical problems instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Fundamentally, the methods you used to solve them are similar to an extent.</strong></p>\n<p>Now if you stop back for a second and think, you can start seeing the world as a series of changes depending on each other. Maybe one thing depends on one other thing (calculus) or maybe one thing depends on many other things (multivariable). It is all about finding a way to model nature accurately.</p>\n<ul><li><em> </em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>(Extra) Part IV: Is this Artificial Intelligence then?</strong></p>\n<p>Not quite, but the input-output mental model remains.</p>\n<p>All the above equations I showed you fundamentally takes some input and provide some output, but some person (or renaissance period polymath) must have decided that the equation must look like that. No one just wakes up and decide the fluid equations to be in that very form.</p>\n<p>Here comes AI (or more specifically neural networks &amp; deep learning)!</p>\n<p>Traditionally, we try to write the equation out that should be solved for an output. But let’s say hey, we don’t actually need a equation since the output (answer) is what really matters to us. <strong>What if we can give a computer lots of examples (data) and it finds some pattern for us?</strong></p>\n<p>This is what these ‘AI systems’ are essentially doing. It takes in lots of data (hence, big data) and does some black magic to learn patterns and insights we humans cannot see and then provides a useful predictive output.</p>\n<p>But as you can see, the issue is that since we only get an output, we don’t know how the AI has actually learned, nor can we ensure the output we get is what we want or safe. That’s what people mean when AI is actually just a black box. Also why I think interpretability is a direction worth spending time on.</p>\n<ul><li><em> </em></li></ul>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<p>This essay was kind of inspired after a similar conversation occurring a few times with friends studying across various STEM fields. I figured if this idea was novel to them, to those in the social/humanities, it might be of interest too.</p>"

    "content": "<h3>my initial theory</h3>\n<p>I brought up this working hypothesis with a few friends.</p>\n<blockquote> The best conversation trick in all walks of life is to know what’s best or most prestigious in as many fields as possible.</blockquote>\n<p>My logic was along the lines of this: Everyone is obviously involved in some industry, domain or has some interest. By knowing the ‘best’ in their industries, or hobbies and being able to name-drop it in your conversation with them, it prompts the discussion towards a direction they are obviously educated or passionate about. And people talk the most when they are knowledgeable and opinionated.</p>\n<p>Say the biggest football clubs, the most prestigious private equity firms or the greatest fashion designers.</p>\n<p>It’s like talking to foreign friend and casually dropping a national dish or word in their native language. They’ll go ‘wait, how do you know that’. My experience suggests a similar reaction with this approach, knowing their interest.</p>\n<p>With the suitable follow-up, you’ve set yourself up for a mildly less awkward conversation. The hallmark wisdom of conversing is to get people talking about themselves.</p>\n<p>I got pushed back that this theory assumes that one must be interested in prestige for this to work. Similarly, with the wrong person, you also come off with the risk of being unable to discuss further beyond your surface understanding: being able to talk the talk but not walk the walk.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent some time refining the idea.</p>\n<h3>your interest should be benchmarked</h3>\n<p>I’ve since consolidated my theory to this:</p>\n<blockquote>Know as many players in as many games as possible. And know the benchmarks of the game.</blockquote>\n<p>I use the word _game_ as a loose term in place of industry, domain, hobby, interest etc.</p>\n<p>I think it ties into knowing the nuances in excellence for each field or art - it gives you something to notice and look for. A side benefit of basically trying a bunch of things in life is that you get to experience what is hard. Shaving 5 minutes off a marathon seems easy on the outside, until you hit the roads and try it out yourself.</p>\n<p>Just to name a few examples:</p>\n<ul><li>To talk to a runner, having a mental benchmark of what a fast km is helps ground the conversation.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To talk about watches, know the main brands and the ‘if you know, you know’ type of features of watches, like the type of band or nuances in bezel color.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To talk about coffee, know the difference between espresso machines, cold brew/drip coffees, or the AeroPress.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To talk about suits, know the difference between an Italian vs American tailored cut or notice collar gaps and oversized suits.</li></ul>\n<p>Asking questions is an innocuous way of employing this technique, without appearing sort of overly aggressive or dismissive of their field. You don’t have to actually know too much about how the espresso machine actually makes the coffee - you just need to bring up that you are aware of the difference and nuances of their interest.</p>\n<h3>getting the ball rolling</h3>\n<p>This strategy works best for getting the ball rolling - once their initial comments are out, you switch back to the regular conversation tricks from Dale Carnegie or whatever power law from Robert Greene. Or whatever rocks your boat.</p>\n<p>It gets the awkwardness out of the way.</p>\n<p>Emil once told me about his friend who claims to have watched movies just by having read their Wikipedia page summary. This strategy sort of reminds me of that, just don’t cap too hard though.</p>\n<p>I guess it definitely takes some innate curiosity to be able to channel effort to grasp the greats across various domains. Maybe there is an optimal strategy for knowing the players and benchmarks in this list of 4-5 domains and being able to deploy it with 80% of the population; I’m thinking knowing one sport (e.g, Basketball/Football) will be pretty high leverage. Knowing the latest of something (celebs/songs/movies) also works quite well. I will have to put more thought into refining a more optimal list, though - perhaps an essay for another day.</p>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<p>I wrote this mini essay to get my productive spirits up again. I’ve been having lots of thoughts on AI, policy, and general reflections recently, resulting in too many half-finished pieces. They shall see the light of day soon.</p>"

    "excerpt": "",
    "content": "<p>I checked my watch. 21:28 3rd of April 2025. I was just sitting there in an empty park, slowly swaying back and forth on a swing.</p>\n<p>Out of nowhere, I heard a faint ‘sewwyyyy’. Followed by a thump on the ground from a silhouette with Ronaldo’s stance.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, a kid, no taller than the gates he had just leaped over, had sort of just spawned there. He rushed past me on the swing and remarked “Gosh you are so boring just sitting there. Booooooring.”</p>\n<p>I was taken aback by this surprising first remark from a stranger. I replied back “hey, it’s nice!”</p>\n<p>He swerved around the monkey bars and picked up his sweater from the floor, then made his way towards the empty swing seat to my right.</p>\n<p>“How old are you? 13? 15?” he questioned me.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t sure whether I was to take that as a compliment or insult: “I’m a little older than that, I’m 19 now.”</p>\n<p>He started to add momentum to the swing by stretching his legs and replied “Oh cool, I’m 10 and 3/4. But anyway, I was playing football here for 3 hours earlier but left my sweater here so I’m here to pick it up alone. I just finished 1/8th of the Lasagna at home, but my baby sisters are probably still eating. I finished as fast as I could so I didn’t have to talk to them. I live somewhere around the corner. But anyway, the swing is so boring, you’re so boring, why are you sitting here?”</p>\n<p>He seemed to have some personal vendetta against the swing. I explained to him I had just gone for a run and was just resting here before I went home, which was just across the road.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you go home then? You can rest there. And why sit on the swing, you can sit on the park bench or even on the slide!”</p>\n<p>I told him I enjoyed just sitting here, it was relaxing with the back-and-forth motion.</p>\n<p>“The swing is so boring. I never sit here.”</p>\n<p>I rebutted, “Then why are you on the swing next to me?”</p>\n<p>“Well, ‘cause I am talking to you. Duh…” Good point, kid.</p>\n<p>He continued, “Anyway, you know what brain rot is? I play Brawl Stars, and Max is my favorite character; do you play any games? I also play football, goalkeeper and striker like Ronaldo. Do you play any sports?”</p>\n<p>I told him “Yeah, no, school is too busy for me, I don’t really have time to do all that”. I’ve always felt uneasy using my lack of time as a cheap excuse for anything; I know I’m just covering up some deeper reason for my inaction.</p>\n<p>He cut off my train of thought and looked at me. “I don’t know many teenagers but I saw this meme and it said that: adults have money but not time, kids have time but no money, and teenagers have no time and no money. Is is true?”</p>\n<p>I laughed. “Yeah seems pretty right, you know…“</p>\n<p>He cut me off again before I could finish validating his claim. “Well if you don’t have time to do anything then why are you just sitting here on the swing? You could be like me playing football or brawl stars. I guess you just don’t want to.”</p>\n<p>“You know, maybe you’re right.” I liked his bluntness.</p>\n<p>“I think you have the time to do fun stuff if you want to. I saw the Minecraft movie and played football for 3 hours and went to school all in one day. Oh and deal with my sisters who cry for 1 hour each day. I’m half your age, but I think I’ve done more than you.”</p>\n<p>He wasn’t wrong. As a kid, he just did things. He didn’t weigh in on whether watching the Minecraft movie for 2 hours or playing football for 3 hours would take away time from playing Brawl Stars. He didn’t think about optimizing the hours of his day - he was a man of momentum. Avoiding boredom was his goal, not trying to feel productive. But by minimizing boredom, he was truly maximizing potential productivity. I obviously wasn’t maximizing every waking hour, so time was not the bottleneck to my inaction; I need to put my focus on doing things that I have the energy to do at the moment and not an ounce on debating whether there is something better I can do in this instance. My true bottleneck was focus, energy, or courage.*</p>\n<p>Perhaps that’s the subconscious reason why I preferred sitting on the swings over the park bench, it made me feel as though I was doing something moving back and forth. I couldn’t justify just idly sitting on the park bench like a wasteman, and the motion of the swing served as my excuse.</p>\n<p>A car vroomed by behind the gates of the park. ‘That’s my Dad, gotta go!’</p>\n<p>He leaped off the swing and headed in the distance towards the car, jumping above the bushes and gate that still towered him. “I’ll probably never see you again. See you never!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, probably not, see you never” I replied.</p>\n<blockquote>frequently “I don’t have enough time” is polite social fiction , and that’s good actually. but you shouldn’t accidentally start believing it yourself. ~ <a href=\"https://x.com/tautologer/status/1903524222275924105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tautologer</a></blockquote>"

I’ve also tried to gaslight myself into the desire to balance my overconsumption of brainrot with some production. But the excuses just piled up and starting this little writing gig soon became harder than my postgrad machine learning course - until I realised I can literally just write about why I should write.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I won’t take this writing gig too seriously - in a sense, I won’t try to perfect each piece and publish, but probably momentarily write up and dump my brains onto the page.</p>\n<p>I’ve always seen writing as medium of thinking for yourself ahead of time; you know, like writing a script for your future conversation. I’ve also come to the belief that forming my own world view and series of predictions will probably be the best life/career guidance I can have at this point of life. There’s nothing more exciting to me than hearing others gush about their convictions with unparalleled passion; there’s something revealing about one’s personality via their ideas (platitudes and niche ones alike). Perhaps my reason shall be this for now: I will write to figure out where my convictions lie.</p>\n<p>For most parts of education and life, I’ve been dabbling in things that sort of appeared to me as interesting with no true optimisations. I mediocrely dipped my toes in a range of fields (briefly academic research, government, finance and tech) I cared about at the time, only to catch myself in boredom at the end of it.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s my reels-infected attention span. Maybe it wasn’t for me. Truth is, I’ve been told over and over again that doing one thing well will probably get you furthest in life; but sticking to one thing always seemed to risky to me - it’s my fear of boredom and the dread of the climb up. But the facts don’t lie, high optionality breeds mediocrity.</p>\n<p>For selfish and maybe altruistic reasons (go open source!), fleshing all my ideas and predictions via writing may reveal something deeper about my world view or might hopefully serve as a springboard for further discussions. I’m more likely to spot my own bs on paper than in my head.</p>\n<p>A last note, I’ve always been fortunate enough to be closely surrounded by those who either are on are bullish on a mission with no temptation to pivot or a very well-cut optimised prestigious paths (law, banking and big tech), making it clear what their next step might be.</p>\n<p>To simply put it: I’m surrounded by excellence and I need to take my next steps to catch up, but I can’t do that until I figure out the bearings for my bullishness. And that is one heck of a topic to start writing about.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for my following pieces to come shortly, I’ve been half baking a lot.</p>"
