## Core Governance Ideas in China

- **Unified Governance vs. Democracy**: China's centralized system enables rapid, effective AI deployment and distribution compared to democratic processes.
- **Elite Politics and Technocrats**: Increasing presence of CS/AI-educated leaders in the Central Committee; influence of overseas-returned experts and tech CEOs (e.g., profiles on Kai-Fu Lee, Ma Yi, Harry Shum).
- **Cultural Foundations of Big Tech**: Origins and decision-making in Chinese companies shaped by national priorities.
- **Provincial Dynamics**:
  - Deep competition between provinces.
  - Hangzhou/Zhejiang as innovation hub: Provincial government support for ecosystem; Alibaba's role; closer ties to Silicon Valley than Beijing.
  - Example: Wenfeng Liang (DeepSeek) as a "Demis Hassabis-like" figure in China.
- **Hot Take**: China prioritizes practical adoption and scaling, potentially de-emphasizing existential/technical safety in favor of economic/utility focus.
- **Regulatory Processes**: Licensing requirements for AI models emphasize controllability and alignment with state goals.

## Insights from Afra Wang (Concurrent Newsletter)

Afra Wang, a writer/researcher focusing on parallels between Silicon Valley and China (via her Substack *Concurrent* at https://afraw.substack.com/), provides nuanced observations on Chinese AI:

- **Pragmatic Materialism**: Chinese AI discourse is utilitarian—focused on shipping products, revenue, and strategic objectives rather than superintelligence or existential debates. Emphasis on practical diffusion and adoption rates over frontier capabilities.
- **Topology of Chinese AI**: Describes interconnected "circles" (government-backed institutions, enterprises, startups); highlights mission-driven younger founders (e.g., Liang Wenfeng of DeepSeek).
- **Vibe Shifts**: Recent evangelism of ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) by figures like Alibaba's Eddie Wu signals potential departure from purely instrumentalist rhetoric.
- **Government-Industry Feedback**: Continuous loops between policy and industry; confidence boosted by breakthroughs like DeepSeek.
- **Broader Context**: China as both competitor and "obsessive ideal" for Silicon Valley; focus on infrastructure, scale, and socio-economic utility.

## Hong Kong-Specific Notes

- **AI as Core Industry**: Ambiguous—refers to production, application, or development? Analogous to declaring "energy" a core industry.
- **Public Sector Adoption**: Plans to integrate AI into 200+ public services by 2027: https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3325910/hong-kong-roll-out-ai-use-200-public-service-procedures-end-2027  
  Implications for SMEs: Potential efficiency gains but challenges in adoption.

## Actionable Steps and Networks

- **Journalism/Connections**: Reach out to HKU journalism (e.g., Karen Hao network) and SCMP reporters.
- **AI Safety Contacts**: Leverage existing list of people in HK/Singapore working on AI safety.
- **Research Skills**:
  - Follow Afra Wang's work: https://afraw.substack.com/
  - Use WeChat for primary sources on Chinese AI developments.
- **AI Search References** (for deeper dives):
