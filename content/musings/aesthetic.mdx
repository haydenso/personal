> i've been quite interested in finding what aesthetics/styles i like and the relevant artists, designers or architects within the field.

**historical:**
the aesthetics of ancient greece, the roman empire and republic
- Thomas Cole's Rome paintings

**futurism:**
- robert mccall
(there is a whole wiki on space artists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_artists)

**product:
**- Dieter Rams
- Achille Castiglioni

**career aesthetic:
- I've been quite drawn to the profiles of VCs across the board. The path it took to get there and their relevant experience. VC websites are also so nice.
- the linkedin 'various companies box' + something random like farmer or store owner

other avenues:
- a curated pinterest board has been quite useful for UI 
- johannes' moodboard: https://x.com/johannes_hage/status/1624377827532447751/photo/1
