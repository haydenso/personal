**What does it mean to have taste?**

- Taste of problems, taste of solutions

**Cultural and aesthetic shallowness**

**How effective people study and learn hard concepts**

**Solving market-driven problems vs fundamental problems**

- Market-driven problems are gaps that present themselves because of a marketplace and supply vs demand
- Fundamental problems are links of curiosity
  - Problems driven for scientific understanding
  - Problems driven by moral standards and virtue (though definition can be a little wishy-washy)
  - Problems that don't yield immediate primary economic value but can be foundations for downstream economic opportunity

One way I like to find ideas is to go to conferences/workshops (e.g. latest ICLR/ICML) and see the long/short papers and use it as a springboard for ideas of topics I am interested in. Another good way to learn is via conference workshop tutorials or equivalent for practical step-by-step guides for cool research ideas.

## Footnotes

I will probably update this consistently with new ideas.

I think if you pick a really hard research problem, try to solve it in <8 weeks, blog everything, shoot videos, ship good OSS code and repeat it, you can get hired by a big lab in ~1 year.

Footnotes:  
I will probably update this consistently with new ideas.  
I think if you pick a really hard research problem, try to solve it in <8 weeks, blog everything, shoot videos, ship good oss code and repeat it.  
you can get hired by a big lab in ~1 year.
