One way I like to find ideas is to go on conferences/workshops (e.g latest ICLR/ICML) and see the long/short papers and use it as a spring board for ideas of topics I am interested in.

Footnotes:  
I will probably update this consistently with new ideas.  
I think if you pick a really hard research problem, try to solve it in <8 weeks, blog everything, shoot videos, ship good oss code and repeat it.  
you can get hired by a big lab in ~1 year.
