- service based economies need to think about the governance of adoption, standardization
- there is alpha in the proprietary data for RL environments
- a major portion of HK is employed by SMBs
- McKinsey/Accenture/Deloitte are not touching SMBs
- 'Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will transfer approximately US$5.8 trillion to the next generation between 2023 and 2030'
- we will see a greater transfer or shutdown of businesses in HK
- ai rollup model for mom-and-pop/niche industries
- agi is an engineering/distribution problem imo
