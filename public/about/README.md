This folder is for the images used on the About / Home page.

Place images named like:
- about-1.jpg
- about-2.jpg
- about-3.jpg
- about-4.jpg

They will be referenced by the `ImagesRow` component as `/about/about-1.jpg`, etc. Use JPG/PNG/WebP files. If you want higher-resolution variants, use the same filename with a suffix like `@2x` and update the srcs accordingly in `app/page.tsx`.
